This repository is about the GetBetterWithData health hackthon.

We are assigned to a data cleaning group; Our job is to cut down the 6 G big csv file into small, organized, clean chunks so that other people can work in their laptop for analysis, modeling, prediction and visualization.

Step 2, access the file from ams data server using sql

Step 3, group into four tables and download files

Step 4, visualize the dataset with a few key questions in mind
